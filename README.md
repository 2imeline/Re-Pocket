Various modpacks exist to recreate classic Minecraft versions such as Beta and Legacy Console Edition, but nothing exists to bring back Pocket Edition! Re-Pocket is here to fill that gap.

## 🔎Accuracy
Re-Pocket tries to be a faithful recreation of the classic Pocket Edition Alpha v0.8 experience. Many aspects of the original UI, such as the title screen and settings menus have been brought back and linked with the vanilla settings menus to allow the user to have full control of their game.

## ⚒️Reworked Modern Features
To preserve the simple, adventure feel of Pocket Edition while keeping Minecraft feature-rich, Re-Pocket reworks some modern mechanics to feel like they were introduced gradually through updates to help the game grow, rather than quickly to overhaul major features.
### The Nether Reactor Core 🔥
The Nether Reactor Core returns to Minecraft, but rather than replacing the Nether, it is now a **required** step before accessing it!
### Elytra Nerf 🪽
The Elytra has been **nerfed** to avoid the player becoming overly reliant on it. To compensate, the minecart is buffed so the player is encouraged to build infrastructure
### Enchanting Rework 🌟
- The Enchanting Table is completely **removed**! The player is pushed to rely on trading and adventure
- Mending removed!
### Combat ⚔️
Re-Pocket brings back the **original** combat system as found in original Pocket Edition
### No Hunger 🍗
Both sprinting and hunger have been **completely** removed
### Old world generation ⛰️
The **exact** same generation found in Pocket Edition v0.8.0 has been brought back, but with infinite worlds! _**Seeds from Pocket Edition are generated almost exactly the same in Re-Pocket.**_

...and so much more!
